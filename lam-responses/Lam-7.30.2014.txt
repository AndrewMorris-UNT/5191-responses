Reflection - 7/30/2014

Here is a sample .txt file that you would add to your folder in the GitHub respository. 

A couple things to remember: 

1. Name your file with the following convention: "Lastname-duedate" - e.g. ("Lam-7.30.2014")
2. Make sure to save as a .txt file. No rich text files. Just plain text. 
3. Make sure to "git push" your .txt file so that everyone can access it. 
4. You'll turn in all assignments using GitHub
